                        <p>Robotic design projects, both competitive and recreational, are at the heart of what we do. Our projects are variable in budget, members involved, and duration, but they all go through a similar application and checkpoint process. We are happy to fund enthusiastic members’ ideas and firmly push our teams to accomplish their goals stay on schedule.</p>
                        <p>We are in our first weeks of existence, so our projects list is minimal at this point. As our membership and funding increases, expect to see several exciting new projects!</p>
