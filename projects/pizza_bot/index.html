                        <p>We college students love our pizza, and many students can attest to ordering a late night delivery pizza when times get rough. Here’s a question: what if your late night pizza could deliver itself?</p>
                        <p>Well self-driving cars are your best bet to make happen. But that’s not what the PizzaBot is for at this point… maybe PizzaBot 2.0?
                        Rather, PizzaBot is a cute and simple little robot with a pizza box as a frame that we use to catch peoples’ attention at events. You’d be surprised by how many double-takes you get when you throw some motors and wheels on a box of pizza and make it move on its own.</p>
